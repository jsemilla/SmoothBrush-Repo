  <p><b><h1>Commonly asked question and answers</h1></b></p>
     <p><h3>I would like to paint my room, what do i need to do ?</h3>
        Good question,If you go to a paint store, a paint associate would ask you some typical question to help you in your 
        project, here are some common ones to prepare you.</p>

     <p><b>What are you painting, is it a bedroom, kitchen, office space, garage, garage door,  basement walls, etc. ?</b><br>
        Tell the associate what you are painting.</p>

     <p><b>Do you have a color in my mind ?</b><br>
        It will be easier if you know in advance what exact color you want, you can pick-out a color swatch from the color
        kiosk, or any paint brochure, the swatches and brochures are normally free, and you can take them home, to compare against  
        your walls to see how it looks like. if you are ready, bring it to the store, your color selection with the  
        color-code, and the paint department will dispense the color you requested. there are cases you may require a color
        match, some paint stores can color match by using a computerized scanner.</p>
 
      <p><b>Do i want my paint to be shinny or no shine (this is called sheen)?</b><br>
        The different type of sheen is as follows:<br>
        <ol>
        <li>Flat - No shine, normally use on ceilings.</li>
        <li>Eggshell - Has little shine, easy to wash, normally use on walls and all-living areas.</li>
        <li>Satin - Has a higher shine, easy to wash, normally use on Kitchen and Bathrooms and Kids room.</li>
        <li>Semi-Gloss - Shinny, very easy to wash, normally use on trims, doors and hi-traffic areas.</li>
        <li>High-Gloss - Very Shinny, very easy to wash, normally use on high-traffic areas and trims,
                         Normally you will need to apply a primer for this type of paint.</li>
           <p>Tip: the shinner the paint, the easier to clean.</p>
       </ol></p>  
      <p><b>How much paint do i need ?</b><br>
        Usually a standard room is 10 x 10 sq. ft. and usually requires a gallon of paint, a wall requires at least a quart.<br>
        a galllon can cover from 350 to 400 sq. ft. and a quart can cover at least a  100 sq. ft.</p>
  
      <p><b>If you are new to painting, ask what kind of tools you will need to paint, here is a list:</b><br>
        <ol>
        <li>Painters tape.</li>
        <li>A Paint brush.</li>
        <li>Painters tray and liner.</li>
        <li>A roller.</li>
        <li>Roller sleeves.</li>
            <p>Tip: the thicker the sleeves the less drag.</p>
        <li>Drop sheets (optional, you can use news papers or any sheets).</li>
        <li>Dry wall repair kits (Only if the wall needs repairing).</li>
        </ol></p>
        
  <p id="QA2"><h3>How do i repair a crack on my dry wall ?</h3>
     <b>To repair the drywall, you need to</b><br>
     <ol>    
     <li>Clean the damage surface, scrape off any loose particles.</li>

   <p id="QA3"><h3>Do i need to apply primer or can i apply paint and primer in one ?</h3>
     Traditionally primer is applied first then after the primer has dried you may proceed to apply the paint,
     today there are paints that are classified as paint and primer in one, you do not need to apply a seperate primer, you may apply this type 
     of paint to save you time and money.</p>

   <p id="QA4"><h3>How do I apply the paint ?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before applying the paint, make sure that the surface is clean, and all cracks and imperfections have
            been fixed.</li>

        <li>Open the can of paint, and pour the paint into the paint tray.</li>
        <li>Use the brush and dip it to the painter tray, remove excess paint from the brush by scraping againts
            the paint tray.</li>
        <li>Paint the corners of the wall first, paint approximately 2 icnhes from the painters tape.</li>
        <li>Dip the paint roller into the paint tray, and scrape of excess paint using the grooves in the paint tray.</li>
        <li>Wait for about 5 seconds before removing the paint roller from the paint tray, this is done to prevent any spillage.</li>
        <li>Customarily you make the "W" technique, basically the paint is applied in a wide "W" pattern, then paint veritically to cover the gaps between the "W".</lI> 
        <li>Work in 3 foot sections.</li>
        <li>Frequently dip the roller into the paint tray, do not let the paint roller to dry.</li>
        <li>If you wish to apply a second coat, wait for the first layer to dry for an hour, then apply the second coat.</li>
