  <p><b><h1>Commonly asked question and answers</h1></b></p>
     <p><h3>I would like to paint my room, what do i need to do ?</h3>
        Good question,If you go to a paint store, a paint associate would ask you some typical question to help you in your                project, here are some common ones to prepare you.</p>

     <p><b>What are you painting, is it a bedroom, kitchen, office space, garage, garage door,  basement walls, etc. ?              </b><br>
        Tell the associate what you are painting.</p>

     <p><b>Do you have a color in my mind?</b><br>
        It will be easier if you know in advance what exact color you want, you can pick-out a color swatch from the color                  kiosk, or any paint brochure, the swatches and brochures are normally free, and you can take them home, to compare against         your walls to see how it looks like. if you are ready, bring to the store you color selection with the approriate color-           code, and the paint department will dispense the color you requested. there are cases you may require a color                      match, some paint stores can color match by using a computerized scanner.</p>
 
      <p><b>Do i want my paint to be shinny or no shine (this is called sheen)?</b><br>
        The different type of sheen is as follows:<br>
        <ol>
        <li>Flat - No shine, normally use on ceilings.</li>
        <li>Eggshell - Has little shine, easy to wash, normally use on walls and all-living areas.</li>
        <li>Satin - Has a higher shine, easy to wash, normally use on Kitchen and Bathrooms, Kids room.</li>
        <li>Semi-Gloss - Shinny, very easy to wash, normally use on trims, doors, hi-traffic areas.</li>
        <li>High-Gloss - Very Shinny, very easy to wash, normally use on high-traffic areas and trims,
                         Normally you will need to apply a primer for this type of paint.</li>
           <p>Tip: the shinner the paint, the easier to clean.</p>
       </ol></p>  
      <p><b>How much paint do i need ?</b><br>
        Usually a standard room is 10 by 10 and usually requires 1 gallon of paint, a wall requires at  a  quart.<br>
        a galllon can cover 350-400 SqFt. and a quart can cover a 100 SqFt.</p>
  
      <p><b>Because you are new to this, ask what kind of tools you will need to paint, here is a list:</b><br>
        <ol>
        <li>Painters tape.</li>
        <li>A Paint brush.</li>
        <li>Painters tray and liner.</li>
        <li>A roller.</li>
        <li>Roller sleeves.</li>
            <p>Tip: the thicker the sleeves the less drag.</p>

        </ol></p>

   <p id="QA3"><h3>Do i need to apply primer or can i apply paint and primer in one ?</h3>
     Traditionally primer is applied first then after the primer has dried you may proceed to apply the paint,
     today there are paints that are classified as paint and primer in one, you do not need to apply a seperate primer, you may apply this type 
     of paint to save you time and money. (Refer to Primer section for additional details)</p>

            been fixed.</li>

        <li>Work in 3 foot sections.</li>
        <li>Frequently dip the roller into the paint tray, do not let the paint roller to dry.</li>
