        <p>With your answers ready, visit a paint store, a paint associate would ask you some typical question to help you in your 
           project, here are some common ones to prepare you.</p>

    

    
        <p><b>What are you painting, is it a bedroom, kitchen, office space, garage, garage door,  basement walls, etc. ?</b><br>
               Tell the associate what you are painting.</p>

        <p><b>Do you have a color in my mind ?</b><br>
               It will be easier if you know in advance what exact color you want, you can pick-out a color swatch from the color
               kiosk, or any paint brochure, the swatches and brochures are normally free, and you can take them home, to compare against  
               your walls to see how it looks like. if you are ready, bring it to the store, your color selection with the  
               color-code, and the paint department will dispense the color you requested. there are cases you may require a color
               match, some paint stores can color match by using a computerized scanner.</p>
 
 
 
        <p><b>Do i want my paint to be shinny or no shine (this is called sheen)?</b><br>
               The different type of sheen is as follows:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Flat - No shine, normally use on ceilings.</li>
            <li>Eggshell - Has little shine, easy to wash, normally use on walls and all-living areas.</li>
            <li>Satin - Has a higher shine, easy to wash, normally use on Kitchen and Bathrooms and Kids room.</li>
            <li>Semi-Gloss - Shinny, very easy to wash, normally use on trims, doors and hi-traffic areas.</li>
            <li>High-Gloss - Very Shinny, very easy to wash, normally use on high-traffic areas and trims,
                Normally you will need to apply a primer for this type of paint.</li>
                <p>Tip: the shinner the paint, the easier to clean.</p>
        </ol></p>  
        
        <p><b>How much paint do i need ?</b><br>
               Usually a standard room is 10 x 10 sq. ft. and usually requires a gallon of paint, a wall requires at least a quart.<br>
               a galllon can cover from 350 to 400 sq. ft. and a quart can cover at least a  100 sq. ft.</p>
